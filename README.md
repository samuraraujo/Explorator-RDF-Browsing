#Explorator - a tool browser for exploring RDF data and Sparql Enpoints

Explorator is a tool for exploring RDF data by direct manipulation. Exploratorâ€™s web interface allows users to explore a semi-structured RDF database to both gain knowledge and answer specific questions about a domain, through browsing, search, and exploration mechanisms.

You can access a demo of Explorator here: http://www.tecweb.inf.puc-rio.br/explorator/demo (doesn't work properly in IE).
